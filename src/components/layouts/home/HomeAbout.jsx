                            <p>The Ultra dB low-noise indoor sewage system is a complete system of pipes and fittings made of mineral-enhanced polypropylene, compliant with the requirements specified in the National Technical Assessment ITB-KOT-2017/0167. Each pipe has a double-layered structure consisting of the internal (white) wall and the external (blue) wall which is smooth, resistant to dirt and permanently overprinted with a centimetre scale. Inspection is easy, as the internal surface is smooth and white. The pipes are manufactured in the co-extrusion process, which allows for the creation of a molecularly bound solid layer. The fittings are manufactured by injection moulding. Thanks to the use of polypropylene and the special wall structure design, this system meets all the requirements imposed on modern sewage systems, namely: safety, resistance to damage and long-lasting durability!</p>

                                enhanced PP products sought-after on the market while their market share, in comparison with
                                traditional solutions based on PP or PVC-U, is on the increase by the day.
                                The Ultra dB system versions are available with the diameters of 40,50, 75, 110, 125, 160 and 200 mm.
                                The combination of the material composition and wall thickness ensures a very high degree of
                                sound insulation, since the noise level is as low as 16 dB. Lip seals made of a rubber-based
                                compound are used to connect the system components with one another.
                                As the pipes are lightweight, their installation is easy. Thanks to the smooth inner surface of each
                                pipe, waste water encounters little resistance as it is drained, which even if the conduit gradient is
                                extremely slight prevents deposits from forming. Consistently, no sewage putrefaction occurs in
                                the pipes, which thus remain unclogged.
